# wg-foundation-onboarding
The **Foundation Onboarding** [Working Group](https://github.com/ampproject/meta/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#working-groups) is responsible for ensuring the successful completion of the OpenJS Foundation's onboarding process.

For more context, see the [AMP announcement](https://blog.amp.dev/2019/10/10/amp-is-joining-the-openjs-foundation-incubation-program/) and [OpenJS Foundation announcement](https://openjsf.org/blog/2019/10/10/openjs-foundation-welcomes-amp-project-to-help-improve-user-experience-on-the-web/) of AMP joining the OpenJS Foundation's incubation program.

To graduate from the incubation program, AMP must complete the [onboarding checklist](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/350).

The WG maintains an org-level [project board](https://github.com/orgs/ampproject/projects/4) to track all issues related to this effort.

The tentative date for graduation is December 10, 2019.

# Communication Channels

The channel is open to anyone, regardless of membership in the working group.
- The Foundation Onboarding Working Group will have **weekly meetings** to track onboarding progress, open to the community.  Notes from this meeting will serve as weekly status updates. Meetings are listed in the issue tracker using the ["Meeting" label](https://github.com/ampproject/wg-foundation-onboarding/labels/Meeting).
- We will track onboarding work using the [ampproject Onboarding GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/ampproject/projects/4) and the [OpenJS Foundation onboarding checklist issue](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/350)
